public class RecursionTheory {
    //Step 1:- What am I trying to return or do?
    // write this in one simple sentence like : I want to return all subset that start from index i. or I want to return
    // whether two subtrees are symmetric.
    //Step 2:- What's the smallest input I can handle without recursion? this is your base case
    //Step 3:- Ask - How can i break this into smaller problems?
    // I have usually either:
    // 1) move to the next index
    // 2) recurse into left and right (for trees)
    // 3) Make a choice: include vs exclude, pick a number, try one path
    // Step 4:- Arey there multiple option at each step? If yes, it is a decision tree or backtracking
    // multiple option means every steps we need to make decision.
    // Backtracking = decision tree + undoing choices.
    // Step 5:- Do I need to combine results of recursive calls?
    // 1) if solving a counting problem -> combine with +
    // 2) if solving true/false -> combine with ||, &&
    // 3) if solving optimization -> combine with min or max
    // 4) if building list -> collect from each call and return final list.

    // Above all write the recursive strategy in english and write the code. It is the simplest of all. Ask
    //ChatGpt to guide always.
