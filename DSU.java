//    step1-> We have a two arrays one rank array and other one is parent array by default initilize with their
//    own because in the starting every node is itself their parent.
//    step2 -> find ultimate parent of u and v. And also find the rank of their utimate parent whoever rank is
//        greater. we will add the smaller rank tree into the bigger rank tree.
//    step3 -> we need to path compression as well.
